\title{Renewable Energy Grids}
\description{
The \code{renewable} dataset provides a decision matrix (\code{dmat}), a benefit-cost vector (\code{bcvec}), and a weights vector (\code{weights}) for evaluating and ranking renewable energy grid alternatives using multi-criteria decision-making methods.

\format{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{dmat}}{
    A numeric matrix with 10 rows and 14 columns, where each row represents a grid alternative (G1 to G10) and each column represents a criterion. The criteria based on Prior et al (2025), are defined as follows:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{C1} - Local Community (\%): Measures the impact of the energy system on improving local living standards and economic opportunities by providing reliable and clean energy services. Higher percentages indicate greater benefits for the community.
      \item \code{C2} - Social Equity (\%): Evaluates the fairness of energy access and benefit distribution among community members. Higher percentages reflect more equitable outcomes across different social groups.
      \item \code{C3} - Education Awareness (\%): Assesses the public’s knowledge and awareness about renewable energy and sustainable practices. An elevated percentage implies a better-informed community ready to embrace clean energy solutions.
      \item \code{C4} - Emission (Score): Quantifies the harmful emissions (e.g., CO\eqn{_2} or other pollutants) generated by the energy system. This is a cost-type criterion; lower scores are more favourable as they signify reduced environmental harm.
      \item \code{C5} - Biodiversity Loss (Score): Captures the negative impact of the energy project on local ecosystems and species diversity. Being a cost indicator, lower scores are preferable since they represent less biodiversity degradation.
      \item \code{C6} - Sustainable Resources (\%): Represents the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources within the energy system, including aspects like recycling and conservation. Higher percentages demonstrate improved resource sustainability.
      \item \code{C7} - Technological Innovations (Score): Reflects the level of new technology adoption and innovations integrated into the energy system. Higher scores indicate more advanced technological implementations.
      \item \code{C8} - Energy Efficiency (\%): Measures how effectively the energy system converts input into useful output with minimal losses. A higher percentage shows a more efficient operation of the grid.
      \item \code{C9} - Support Infrastructure (Score): Assesses the quality and modernity of the supporting infrastructure, such as smart grids, communication systems, and storage facilities. Higher scores denote a stronger, more modern infrastructure.
      \item \code{C10} - Implementation Cost ($M): Quantifies the initial capital investment required for deploying the energy system, measured in millions of dollars. As a cost-type criterion, lower amounts are typically more desirable. In our simulation, advanced systems may involve higher costs indicative of superior technology.
      \item \code{C11} - Economic Efficiency (%): Evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the energy system over its life cycle (similar to LCOE) by balancing performance with operational costs. Higher percentages indicate more favourable economic performance.
      \item \code{C12} - Governmental Incentives (Score): Gauges the level and strength of governmental support, such as subsidies and incentives, available for the energy project. Higher scores suggest a more supportive policy environment.
      \item \code{C13} - Macroeconomics (Score): Represents the broader economic benefits of the energy system, including impacts on investment, job creation, and infrastructure development. Higher scores are associated with positive macroeconomic contributions.
      \item \code{C14} - Microeconomics (Score): Focuses on project-specific financial indicators (e.g., ROI, NPV) that reflect the viability and profitability of the energy system. Higher scores indicate more attractive economic prospects at the micro level.

    For example, the first row (G1) of \code{dmat} contains the values: 78, 74, 66, 18, 11, 75, 65, 78, 78, 171, 69, 44, 59, and 50.
  }
  \item{\code{bcvec}}{
    A numeric vector of length 14 indicating the type of each criterion:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{1}: Benefit criterion (higher is better).
      \item \code{-1}: Cost criterion (lower is better).
    }
    In this dataset, the benefit-cost vector is: 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
  }
  \item{\code{weights}}{
    A numeric vector of length 14 containing the weights assigned to each criterion. The weights are as follows: 0.10, 0.05, 0.08, 0.08, 0.09, 0.13, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.09, 0.08, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.04, which sum to 1.
  }
}
}
\details{
The dataset is a synthetic dataset designed for evaluating and comparing renewable grid alternatives using multi-criteria decision-making methods. Each row in the decision matrix (\code{dmat}) represents a grid alternative (labeled G1 through G10) and each column corresponds to a specific criterion as described above. The benefit-cost vector (\code{bcvec}) indicates whether a criterion is to be maximized (benefit, 1) or minimized (cost, -1), while the weights vector (\code{weights}) reflects the relative importance of each criterion.
